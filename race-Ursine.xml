		<description>
			<p> In general, ursines are bear-like humanoids with white, brown, or black fur and grayish-black skin beneath. They are very muscular, but also mentally developed. They can don armor and run on all fours or on their hind legs. Their facial fur is particularly long and shaggy, occasionally giving them the grizzled beard appearance. Their eyes are usually some dark color like brown, though dyes have been used.</p>
			<p>Not much is known, except by the ursines themselves, about the history of this race. It is believed they hailed from bears that were originally fey which came through from the Feywilds around the time elves appeared in the Prime. These fey bears mated not only with local bears, but also humans. This resulted in an intelligent species that eventually lost its fey blood a bit and took on a more beastly lineage, who are the ursines. The fey bear's blood dominated much of the appearance aspect.</p>
			<h4>URSINE TRAITS</h4>

			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b>
					<i>Speed. </i>

			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b>
					<i>Sharp Claws. </i>
